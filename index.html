                <p>Wim Hof (born 20 April 1959), also known as The Iceman, is a Dutch motivational speaker and extreme
                    athlete noted for his ability to withstand freezing temperatures. He has set Guinness World Records
                    for

                    barefoot half marathon on ice and snow. He attributes these feats to his Wim Hof Method (WHM), a
                    combination of frequent cold exposure, breathing techniques, yoga and meditation.</p>

                <p>Jay Shetty (born 6 September 1987) is an English author, former Hindu monk, and life coach of Indian
                    descent.</p>
                <p>Hearing a monk speak for the first time at age 21 changed my life. For the next three years, I spent
                    half my summer vacations working for a large financial organization with suits, steak houses and
                    bars
                    and the other half living as a monk in India wearing robes, sleeping on the floor and living out of
                    a
                    gym locker. After three years of back-and-forth, I chose the self-growth and service-focused life of
                    being a monk. For the next three years, I went to live with monks. I woke up at 4 am, meditated for
                    4-8
                    hours, studied timeless wisdom and served others in nearby communities. But I couldnâ€™t stay there
                    forever. I knew there was a different purpose for my life. It was time to go home. Click on the heart icon to learn more about Jay and his journey. </p>
