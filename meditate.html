                    within
                    our natural environment. In this method, Wim trains you with his three pillars. 1 breath Wim will
                    teach
                    you how to breathe for more energy-reduced stress and help immune systems. 2 Cold therapy Proper
                    exposure to the cold starts a cascade of health benefits, including the buildup of brown adipose
                    tissue
                    and resultant fat loss, reduced inflammation that facilitates a fortified immune system, balanced
                    hormone levels, improved sleep quality, and the production of endorphins. 3 Commitment both cold
                    exposure and conscious breathing require patience and dedication in order to be fully mastered.
                    Armed
                    with focus and determination you are ready to explore and eventually master your own body and mind.
