            <h2>Wim Hoff</h2>
            <h3>Wim Hof (born 20 April 1959), also known as The Iceman, is a Dutch motivational speaker and extreme
                athlete noted for his ability to withstand freezing temperatures. He has set Guinness World Records for
                swimming under ice and prolonged full-body contact with ice, and previously held the record for a
                barefoot half marathon on ice and snow. He attributes these feats to his Wim Hof Method (WHM), a
                combination of frequent cold exposure, breathing techniques, yoga and meditation.</h3>
            <h3>The power of the Wim Hof Method is the combination of the three pillars. A committed, consistent
                practice including the breathing technique and cold exposure can help you unlock a host of benefits
                including;

                <ul>
                    <li> Increased energy</li>
                    <li>Better sleep</li>
                    <li> Reduced stress levels</li>
                    <li>Heightened focus & determination</li>
                    <li> Increased willpower</li>
                    <li> Stronger immune system</li>

            <h2>Jay Shetty</h2>
            <h3>Jay Shetty (born 6 September 1987) is an English author, former Hindu monk, and life coach of Indian
                descent.</h3>
            <h3>Hearing a monk speak for the first time at age 21 changed my life. For the next three years, I spent
                half my summer vacations working for a large financial organization with suits, steak houses and bars
                and the other half living as a monk in India wearing robes, sleeping on the floor and living out of a
                gym locker. After three years of back-and-forth, I chose the self-growth and service-focused life of
                being a monk. For the next three years, I went to live with monks. I woke up at 4 am, meditated for 4-8
                hours, studied timeless wisdom and served others in nearby communities. But I couldnâ€™t stay there
                forever. I knew there was a different purpose for my life. It was time to go home.</h3>
